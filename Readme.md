# GRE-Vocabulary-Website

### GRE Vocabulary Website implemented using Express and EJS.

A website for finding meanings and synonyms of any given word in the dictionary. Web scraping is used to fetch data about an input word and then the data is parsed and displayed on the website using EJS. A link for the synonyms of the input word is also generated and displayed in EJS.
